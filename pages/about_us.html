  <p class="sm"> &#160; &#160; CODAX is a dynamic tech community founded by 2 passionate individuals aiming to create an environment where tech enthusiasts can learn, collaborate, and grow together. Our goal is to provide a platform that supports continuous improvement, innovation, and success in the rapidly evolving world of technology. CODAX stands as a beacon for those who seek to expand their knowledge, connect with peers, and make a significant impact in the tech industry.<br>
<br>&#160; &#160;Founded in 2024 by a group of tech enthusiasts and computer science students from the Cotabato region. Recognizing the limited tech opportunities in their local area, the founders envisioned a community that would foster collaboration, mentorship, and innovation. CODAX was created to fill that gap, offering a supportive and engaging environment for like-minded individuals to connect, learn, and inspire each other.<br>
 <br>&#160; &#160;  CODAX thrives as a hub for students mostly and tech enthusiasts to collaborate, share knowledge, and elevate one another. Its playful, coding-inspired duck logo reflects the community’s fun and approachable nature. CODAX remains committed to adapting and innovating alongside its members, ensuring it remains an inspiring community in the tech landscape, locally and globally.
